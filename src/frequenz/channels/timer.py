# Quick Start

Info: Important
    This quick start is provided to have a quick feeling of how to use this module, but
    it is extremely important to understand how timers behave when they are delayed.

    We recommend emphatically to read about [missed ticks and
    drifting](#missed-ticks-and-drifting) before using timers in production.

If you need to do something as periodically as possible (avoiding
[drifts](#missed-ticks-and-drifting)), you can use
a [`Timer`][frequenz.channels.timer.Timer] like this:

Example: Periodic Timer Example
    ```python
    import asyncio
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta

    from frequenz.channels.timer import Timer


    async def main() -> None:
        async for drift in Timer(timedelta(seconds=1.0), TriggerAllMissed()):
            print(f"The timer has triggered at {datetime.now()} with a drift of {drift}")


    asyncio.run(main())
    ```

    This timer will tick as close as every second as possible, even if the loop is busy
    doing something else for a good amount of time. In extreme cases, if the loop was
    busy for a few seconds, the timer will trigger a few times in a row to catch up, one
    for every missed tick.

If, instead, you need a timeout, for example to abort waiting for other receivers after
a certain amount of time, you can use a [`Timer`][frequenz.channels.timer.Timer] like
this:

Example: Timeout Example
    ```python
    import asyncio
    from datetime import timedelta

    from frequenz.channels import Anycast, select, selected_from
    from frequenz.channels.timer import Timer


    async def main() -> None:
        channel = Anycast[int](name="data-channel")
        data_receiver = channel.new_receiver()

        timer = Timer(timedelta(seconds=1.0), SkipMissedAndDrift())

        async for selected in select(data_receiver, timer):
            if selected_from(selected, data_receiver):
                print(f"Received data: {selected.message}")
                timer.reset()
            elif selected_from(selected, timer):
                drift = selected.message
                print(f"No data received for {timer.interval + drift} seconds, giving up")
                break


    asyncio.run(main())
    ```

    This timer will *rearm* itself automatically after it was triggered, so it will
    trigger again after the selected interval, no matter what the current drift was. So
    if the loop was busy for a few seconds, the timer will trigger immediately and then
    wait for another second before triggering again. The missed ticks are skipped.

# Missed Ticks And Drifting

A [`Timer`][frequenz.channels.timer.Timer] can be used to send a messages at regular
time intervals, but there is one fundamental issue with timers in the [asyncio][] world:
the event loop could give control to another task at any time, and that task can take
a long time to finish, making the time it takes the next timer message to be received
longer than the desired interval.

Because of this, it is very important for users to be able to understand and control
how timers behave when they are delayed. Timers will handle missed ticks according to
a *missing tick policy*.

The following built-in policies are available:

* [`SkipMissedAndDrift`][frequenz.channels.timer.SkipMissedAndDrift]:
    {{docstring_summary("frequenz.channels.timer.SkipMissedAndDrift")}}
* [`SkipMissedAndResync`][frequenz.channels.timer.SkipMissedAndResync]:

* [`TriggerAllMissed`][frequenz.channels.timer.TriggerAllMissed]:

    The reset happens only if the delay is larger than the

    [`Timer`][frequenz.channels.timer.Timer]s are started by default after they are
    created. This can be disabled by using `auto_start=False` option when creating
    them. In this case, the timer will not be started until
    [`reset()`][frequenz.channels.timer.Timer.reset] is called. Receiving from the timer
    (either using [`receive()`][frequenz.channels.timer.Timer.receive] or using the
    async iterator interface) will also start the timer at that point.

    Timers need to be created in a context where
    a [`asyncio`][] loop is already running. If no
    [`loop`][frequenz.channels.timer.Timer.loop] is specified, the current running loop
    is used.

    Timers can be stopped by calling [`stop()`][frequenz.channels.timer.Timer.stop].
    A stopped timer will raise
    a [`ReceiverStoppedError`][frequenz.channels.ReceiverStoppedError] or stop the async
    iteration as usual.

    Once a timer is explicitly stopped, it can only be started again by explicitly
    calling [`reset()`][frequenz.channels.timer.Timer.reset] (trying to receive from it
    or using the async iterator interface will keep failing).

    Timer messages are [`timedelta`][datetime.timedelta]s containing the drift of the
    timer, i.e. the difference between when the timer should have triggered and the time
    when it actually triggered.

    This drift will likely never be `0`, because if there is a task that is
    running when it should trigger, the timer will be delayed. In this case the
    drift will be positive. A negative drift should be technically impossible,
    as the timer uses [`asyncio`][]s loop monotonic clock.

    Warning:
        Even when the [`asyncio`][] loop's monotonic clock is a [`float`][], timers use
        `int`s to represent time internally. The internal time is tracked in
        microseconds, so the timer resolution is 1 microsecond
        ([`interval`][frequenz.channels.timer.Timer.interval] must be at least
         1 microsecond).

        This is to avoid floating point errors when performing calculations with time,
        which can lead to issues that are very hard to reproduce and debug.

    If the timer is delayed too much, then it will behave according to the
    [`missed_tick_policy`][frequenz.channels.timer.Timer.missed_tick_policy]. Missing
    ticks might or might not trigger a message and the drift could be accumulated or not
    depending on the chosen policy.
