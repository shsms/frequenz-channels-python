    # Description

    [Broadcast][frequenz.channels.Broadcast] channels can have multiple
    [senders][frequenz.channels.Sender] and multiple
    [receivers][frequenz.channels.Receiver]. Each message sent through any of the
    senders will be received by all receivers.

    ```bob
    .---------. msg1                           msg1,msg2  .-----------.
    | Sender  +------.                        .---------->| Receiver  |

    '---------' msg2                           msg1,msg2  '-----------'
    ```
    </center>

    !!! Note inline end "Characteristics"

        * **Buffered:** Yes, with one buffer per receiver
        * **Buffer full policy:** Drop oldest message
        * **Multiple receivers:** Yes
        * **Multiple senders:** Yes
        * **Thread-safe:** No

    This channel is buffered, and when messages are not being consumed fast
    enough and the buffer fills up, old messages will get dropped.

    Each receiver has its own buffer, so messages will only be dropped for
    receivers that can't keep up with the senders, and not for the whole
    channel.

    To create a new [senders][frequenz.channels.Sender] and
    [receivers][frequenz.channels.Receiver] you can use the
    [`new_sender()`][frequenz.channels.Broadcast.new_sender] and
    [`new_receiver()`][frequenz.channels.Broadcast.new_receiver] methods
    respectively.

    When a channel is not needed anymore, it should be closed with
    [`close()`][frequenz.channels.Broadcast.close]. This will prevent further
    attempts to [`send()`][frequenz.channels.Sender.send] data, and will allow
    receivers to drain the pending items on their queues, but after that,
    subsequent [receive()][frequenz.channels.Receiver.receive] calls will
    raise a [`ReceiverStoppedError`][frequenz.channels.ReceiverStoppedError].

    This channel is useful, for example, to implement a pub/sub pattern, where
    multiple receivers can subscribe to a channel to receive all messages.

    In cases where each message needs to be delivered only to one receiver, an
    [anycast][frequenz.channels.Anycast] channel may be used.

    # Examples

    Example: Send a few numbers to a receiver
        This is a very simple example that sends a few numbers from a single sender to
        a single receiver.

        ```python
        import asyncio

        from frequenz.channels import Broadcast, Sender


        async def send(sender: Sender[int]) -> None:
            for message in range(3):
                print(f"sending {message}")
                await sender.send(message)


        async def main() -> None:
            channel = Broadcast[int](name="numbers")

            sender = channel.new_sender()
            receiver = channel.new_receiver()

            async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as task_group:
                task_group.create_task(send(sender))
                for _ in range(3):
                    message = await receiver.receive()
                    print(f"received {message}")
                    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # sleep (or work) with the data


        asyncio.run(main())
        ```

        The output should look something like (although the sending and received might
        appear more interleaved):

        ```
        sending 0
        sending 1
        sending 2
        received 0
        received 1
        received 2
        ```

    Example: Send a few number from multiple senders to multiple receivers
        This is a more complex example that sends a few numbers from multiple senders to
        multiple receivers, using a small buffer to force the senders to block.

        ```python
        import asyncio

        from frequenz.channels import Broadcast, Receiver, ReceiverStoppedError, Sender


        async def send(name: str, sender: Sender[int], start: int, stop: int) -> None:
            for message in range(start, stop):
                print(f"{name} sending {message}")
                await sender.send(message)


        async def recv(name: str, receiver: Receiver[int]) -> None:
            try:
                async for message in receiver:
                    print(f"{name} received {message}")
                await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # sleep (or work) with the data
            except ReceiverStoppedError:
                pass


        async def main() -> None:
            acast = Broadcast[int](name="numbers")

            async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as task_group:
                task_group.create_task(send("sender_1", acast.new_sender(), 10, 13))
                task_group.create_task(send("sender_2", acast.new_sender(), 20, 22))
                task_group.create_task(recv("receiver_1", acast.new_receiver()))
                task_group.create_task(recv("receiver_2", acast.new_receiver()))


        asyncio.run(main())
        ```

        The output should look something like this(although the sending and received
        might appear interleaved in a different way):

        ```
        sender_1 sending 10
        sender_1 sending 11
        sender_1 sending 12
        sender_2 sending 20
        sender_2 sending 21
        receiver_1 received 10
        receiver_1 received 11
        receiver_1 received 12
        receiver_1 received 20
        receiver_1 received 21
        receiver_2 received 10
        receiver_2 received 11
        receiver_2 received 12
        receiver_2 received 20
        receiver_2 received 21
