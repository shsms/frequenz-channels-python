class Timer(Receiver[timedelta]):
    """A timer receiver that triggers every `interval` time.

    The timer as microseconds resolution, so the `interval` must be at least
    1 microsecond.

    The message it produces is a `timedelta` containing the drift of the timer,
    i.e. the difference between when the timer should have triggered and the time
    when it actually triggered.

    This drift will likely never be `0`, because if there is a task that is
    running when it should trigger, the timer will be delayed. In this case the
    drift will be positive. A negative drift should be technically impossible,
    as the timer uses `asyncio`s loop monotonic clock.

    If the timer is delayed too much, then the timer will behave according to
    the `missed_tick_policy`. Missing ticks might or might not trigger
    a message and the drift could be accumulated or not depending on the
    chosen policy.

    The timer accepts an optional `loop`, which will be used to track the time.
    If `loop` is `None`, then the running loop will be used (if there is no
    running loop most calls will raise a `RuntimeError`).

    Starting the timer can be delayed if necessary by using `auto_start=False`
    (for example until we have a running loop). A call to `reset()`, `ready()`,
    `receive()` or the async iterator interface to await for a new message will
    start the timer.

    For the most common cases, a specialized constructor is provided:

    * [`periodic()`][frequenz.channels.util.Timer.periodic]
    * [`timeout()`][frequenz.channels.util.Timer.timeout]

    Example: Periodic timer example
        ```python
        from frequenz.channels.util import Timer
        from datetime import timedelta

        async for drift in Timer.periodic(timedelta(seconds=1.0)):
            print(f"The timer has triggered {drift=}")
        ```

        But you can also use a [`select`][frequenz.channels.util.select] to combine
        it with other receivers, and even start it (semi) manually:

        ```python
        import logging
        from datetime import timedelta
        from frequenz.channels.util import Timer, select, selected_from
        from frequenz.channels import Broadcast

        timer = Timer.timeout(timedelta(seconds=1.0), auto_start=False)
        chan = Broadcast[int]("input-chan")
        battery_data = chan.new_receiver()

        timer = Timer.timeout(timedelta(seconds=1.0), auto_start=False)
        # Do some other initialization, the timer will start automatically if
        # a message is awaited (or manually via `reset()`).
        async for selected in select(battery_data, timer):
            if selected_from(selected, battery_data):
                if selected.was_closed():
                    logging.warning("battery channel closed")
                    continue
                battery_soc = selected.value
            elif selected_from(selected, timer):
                # Print some regular battery data
                print(f"Battery is charged at {battery_soc}%")
        ```

    Example: Timeout example
        ```python
        import logging
        from frequenz.channels.util import Timer, select, selected_from
        from frequenz.channels import Broadcast
        from datetime import timedelta

        def process_data(data: int):
            logging.info("Processing data: %d", data)

        def do_heavy_processing(data: int):
            logging.info("Heavy processing data: %d", data)

        timer = Timer.timeout(timedelta(seconds=1.0), auto_start=False)
        chan1 = Broadcast[int]("input-chan-1")
        chan2 = Broadcast[int]("input-chan-2")
        battery_data = chan1.new_receiver()
        heavy_process = chan2.new_receiver()
        async for selected in select(battery_data, heavy_process, timer):
            if selected_from(selected, battery_data):
                if selected.was_closed():
                    logging.warning("battery channel closed")
                    continue
                process_data(selected.value)
                timer.reset()
            elif selected_from(selected, heavy_process):
                if selected.was_closed():
                    logging.warning("processing channel closed")
                    continue
                do_heavy_processing(selected.value)
            elif selected_from(selected, timer):
                logging.warning("No data received in time")
        ```

        In this case `do_heavy_processing` might take 2 seconds, and we don't
        want our timeout timer to trigger for the missed ticks, and want the
        next tick to be relative to the time timer was last triggered.
