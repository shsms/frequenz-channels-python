    Example:
        For example, if there are two channel receivers with the same type,
        they can be awaited together, and their results merged into a single
        stream, by using `Merge` like this:

        ```python
        from frequenz.channels import Broadcast
        from frequenz.channels.util import Merge

        channel1 = Broadcast[int]("input-chan-1")
        channel2 = Broadcast[int]("input-chan-2")
        receiver1 = channel1.new_receiver()
        receiver2 = channel2.new_receiver()

        merge = Merge(receiver1, receiver2)
        while msg := await merge.receive():
            # do something with msg
            pass
        ```

        When `merge` is no longer needed, then it should be stopped using
        `self.stop()` method. This will cleanup any internal pending async tasks.
